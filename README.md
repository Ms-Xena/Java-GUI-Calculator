# Java-GUI-Calculator
This straightforward yet user-friendly Java-based GUI calculator, created with Swing and AWT, is my very first Java project. It uses interactive buttons and clear input fields to carry out addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, the fundamental arithmetic operations. After entering two numbers and pressing a button, users can see the outcome in an uneditable text field right away. Action listeners manage the logic behind the scenes, and the interface is simple yet effective, utilizing Java's JFrame, JTextField, and JButton components. I was able to learn the basics of Java event-driven programming and GUI design thanks to this project.
